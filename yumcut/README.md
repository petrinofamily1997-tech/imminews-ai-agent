# YumCut

Open-source AI short video generator for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels.

[YumCut](https://yumcut.com/?utm_source=github_app_yc) is a free/self-hosted alternative to closed short-video SaaS tools for end-to-end short-form production.

YumCut is built for creators, agencies, and growth teams that need to produce short vertical videos fast and consistently.
You provide the idea, YumCut generates the script, voice, visuals, captions, and final edit for a ready-to-post 9:16 video.

Purpose of the project:

- turn short-form production into a repeatable workflow instead of manual editing chaos
- reduce production cost with open-source/self-hosted control
- help teams publish more often and test more content ideas per week

Main use cases:

- daily TikTok / YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels publishing for faceless channels
- turning one idea into multiple language versions for wider reach
- testing different hooks/styles quickly without rebuilding videos from scratch
- agency-style batch production across multiple brands or clients

## User API for Automation and AI Agents

YumCut includes a bearer-key User API for automating project workflows from external tools, backend jobs, and AI agents.
Users can create API keys in the app and use the API to manage their own projects end to end: quote token costs, create video or Image Prank projects, poll status, stop or cancel work, update settings, read catalog data, and fetch final media download URLs.

- Interactive docs: [app.yumcut.com/api/user/v1/docs](https://app.yumcut.com/api/user/v1/docs)
- OpenAPI schema: [app.yumcut.com/api/user/v1/openapi.json](https://app.yumcut.com/api/user/v1/openapi.json)
- API key management: [app.yumcut.com/account/api](https://app.yumcut.com/account/api)

The API uses the same account ownership checks, read/write key scopes, token balance rules, and project creation paths as the web app, so automation and AI agents can run production workflows without bypassing credits or user data boundaries.

## Why YumCut

- Open-source and self-hosted: no vendor lock-in, fully auditable code.
- Built for short-form growth workflows: script, voice, visuals, captions, publish-ready outputs.
- Cost control: bring your own providers, run local components where possible, and tune quality/speed trade-offs.
- Production-oriented architecture: separate app + storage modes, signed upload/delete grants, typed API boundaries.

## Cost Positioning

YumCut is positioned as a cost-efficient alternative to premium closed models and platforms.

- For personal use, YumCut is free.
- The already deployed hosted version is available at [YumCut.com](https://yumcut.com/).
- If you want to host YumCut for clients, sell access, or run it as a commercial service, you need to acquire a commercial license.
- Licensing contact: `igor.shadurin@gmail.com`

- In practice, YumCut video generation can be around 10x cheaper than popular closed video generators, depending on your stack and providers.

Expensive closed-model examples teams often compare against:

- Veo (Vertex AI / premium tiers)
- Runway Gen video models
- Pika premium plans
- Luma Dream Machine paid plans
- other closed, credit-based video generation APIs
